Objects and its internal representation in Javascrip.

Answer:

1.In JavaScript,objects are king.If you understand objects,you understand JavaScript.
2.It forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
3.-A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.
  -A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.
  -JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:
    string,number,boolean,null,undefined
4.JavaScript variables can also contain many values.
   -Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
   -Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
5.Eg.,
      
   let car ={ name:"BMW",
              model:"x1",
              color:black",
              year:2021};

6.Creating Objects in Javascript:

-Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal,
 eg:let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};

-Create JavaScript Object with Constructor,
eg:function Vehicle(name, maker) {
        this.name = name;
        this.maker = maker; }
     let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
     let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
     console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Fiesta
     console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santa Fe'

-Using the JavaScript Keyword new,
eg:var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “John”;
person.lastName = “Doe”;
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = “blue”; 

-Using the Object.create method,
eg:var Animal = {
  type: 'Invertebrates', 
  displayType: function() {  
    console.log(this.type); }
